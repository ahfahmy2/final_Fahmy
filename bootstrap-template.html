                    <p class="dek">The following <a href="https://www.edweek.org/leadership/map-coronavirus-and-school-closures-in-2019-2020/2020/03" target="_blank">data</a> released by educationweek.com shows U.S. school closures in the 2019-20 academic year. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, many schools were forced to suddenly close midway into the spring semester. The data by educationweek.com (with some of it aggregated from the National Center for Education Statistics) shows just how many schools were forced to shut down for the remainder of the academic year and how many students across the U.S. were impacted.</p>

                <div class="section col-md-9">
                    <p>Many suspected that these early closures could hurt students in the long run and that’s what some of the data collected by others suggests. As discussed in this <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/28/upshot/schools-covid-closings.html">article</a> by the NY Times, some students are believed to be, on average, “half a school year behind in math and reading” with some struggling “socially and emotionally.”</p>
                    <p>Many of the findings below focus primarily on public school data so we’d have to look elsewhere for private school data to get a broader perspective on student impact in the U.S.</p>
                    <p>Even now with cases not as high or as rampant as they were around the time of the pandemic, it'll be a while before things go back to the way they were pre-COVID. Academics aside, some students are still struggling to be present in their classes. A Dynata survey of 148,400 parents showed that 25 percent of parents said their kids missed more than a week of school in January of 2022.</p> 
                    <p>Although we seem to have passed what some might consider the height of the pandemic, it's still important to go back and consider the academic toll and psychological burden that students are carrying as a result of what transpired in 2020.</p>

                <h3>Student Mental Health</h3>
                <p>While much of the data we'll look at will cover numbers regarding academic level, perhaps the area students were most impacted by the pandemic was their mental health. According to McKinsey and Co., more than 35 percent of parents are very or extremely concerned about the mental health of their child and these numbers are backed by other reputable sources.</p>

                <p>In the 2021 Adolescent Behavior and Experiences Survey completed by US high school students in early-mid 2021, the CDC reports that 37 percent of students experienced poor mental health during the pandemic. In addition, 44 percent said they had experienced persistent feelings of sadness and hopelessness in the 12 months before the survey and 20 percent said they had seriously contemplated attempting suicide.</p>

                    <h3>Widespread Impact</h3>
                    <p>The following chart serves as a visualization for the data aggregated by educationweek.com. While the impact is similar throughout all 50 U.S. states, this visualization has a primary focus on the east coast. Out of all the findings to arise from this dataset, perhaps the most notable is that these closures affected the academic years of over 15 million K-12 public school students on the east coast.</p>
                    <p>This data isn't necessarily supposed to compare the cases from state to state, but more so to illustrate the significance that the pandemic had on academics across the U.S. as a whole. Millions of K-12 students had their school years abruptly ended prematurely which is quite unprecedented.</p>
                    <p>Audrey Azoulay, the Director-General of UNESCO (the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) echoed similar <a href="https://en.unesco.org/news/290-million-students-out-school-due-covid-19-unesco-releases-first-global-numbers-and-mobilizes">sentiments.</a> In 2020, she argued "the global scale and speed of the current educational disruption is unparalled." Obviously, we have yet to recover.</p>

                    <h3>Academic Fall Off</h3>
                    <p>The previous charts exemplify the obvious academic fall-off that took place as a result of these closures. In the areas of both math and reading, the decline in academic level from pre-covid to the 2020-21 school year is evident. With students 4 months behind in reading and 5 months behind in math, the drop-off might be more severe than most would've anticipated.</p>
                    <p>Many have suggested that in a time of such uncertainty and crisis, students weren't mentally prepared or equipped to maneuver these shutdowns and transition to online learning. Mostafa El Makhzangy, Head of the English Department at El Rowad College seems to agree. "No one was ready to receive any kind of information. Their main concern was who got infected, the number of cases, the number of deaths, is there a vaccine on the horizon."</p>
